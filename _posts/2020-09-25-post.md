On 24th September 2020, I gave a 10-minute talk on [Algorithmic Fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning)) at the University of Bristol's [Mingle 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/mingle2020/home).

On 10th November 2020, I was invited to give an extended version of the same talk at the University of Bristol's [Women and Non-Binary People in Mathematics](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/meeting/women-and-non-binary-people-in-mathematics-phd-opportunities/) event.
