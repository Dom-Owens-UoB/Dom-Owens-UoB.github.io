On 16th September 2021 I presented at the poster session at the [Fry Conference 2021](https://web-eur.cvent.com/event/a5a8878f-5ff8-457d-ad63-09fc66f9afd2/websitePage:e8eec9d9-4a73-444b-868d-626220e41ee8?RefId=SOM). The poster was titled "High-dimensional data segmentation under a sparse regression model" and is based on ongoing work with my supervisor, Dr Haeran Cho.

For this I won the Gold Prize for best poster. My thanks go to Euan McGonigle for some very helpful comments during the making of the poster.
