I'm a [Statistics](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/) PhD student, and part of the [COMPASS CDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) at the University of Bristol.

I'm interested in time series analysis, high dimensional statistics, and non-parametric statistics.
Currently, I'm working on change-point analysis for network time series.
