I'm a [Statistics](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/) PhD student, and part of the [COMPASS CDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) at the University of Bristol.

My interests include:

- Time series analysis

- High dimensional statistics

- Non-parametric statistics

- Large-scale inference

Currently, I'm working on change-point analysis for network time series.
