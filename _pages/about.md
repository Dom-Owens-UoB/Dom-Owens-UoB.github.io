I'm a statistics PhD student in the [COMPASS CDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) and [Institute for Statistical Science](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/statistical-science/) at the University of Bristol.

I work on change point analysis for multivariate and high-dimensional time series, with my supervisor [Dr. Haeran Cho](https://sites.google.com/view/haeran-cho/home).

My interests include:

- Time series and change point analysis

- High dimensional statistics

- Non-parametric statistics

- Large-scale inference

- Economic, financial, and climate applications

As of June 2021, I'm working with [CheckRisk](https://check-risk.com/) on a research internship.
